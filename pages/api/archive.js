    theme: "Switcheroo",
    description:
      "With TEDxJMI themed as switcheroo we want to bring people who endorse the idea of switching careers successfully to a common stage. We believe it is passion that deserves precedence over profession and that it is important to follow your true vocation. At the same time we also acknowledge the fact that vocations can undergo transformations. Whether a person is starting out afresh or is already following a career path, there is always that thought of doing ‘the other thing’. Where most of us fall out is when we need to address this conflict by taking a call. At our event we intend to have a carefully curated speaker line up that motivates the attendees to pursue their inner voice into their preferred line of work. TEDxJMI is a platform that’ll unite people who made successful switches with those who intend to do the same. However, all talks would be centred around the following elements individually or at large.",

    theme: "Different Lenses",
    description:
      "When we're talking about different lenses, we mean different eyes, diverse senses of multifarious individuals, each one unique in its way with a different standpoint, ideology, and way of vitality. This incites a question in our minds, how are we shaped? What molds our thought process? Is it our actions, choices, or the experiences we've had in the past? This takes us to the conclusion that since no two occasions can be the same, no two views will ever match entirely. It is imperative to look beyond our perspective and understand that everyone is distinct and consequently has a distinguishing outlook. It is this diversity that is responsible for the equilibrium in society, harmony in multiplicity, and peace in variousness. The understanding of these nuances makes the world a little more empathetic, and a better place to live in. So herewith this theme, we will bring the seen and the unseen world together for everyone to see the horizon of perspectives.",
